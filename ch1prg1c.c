 Demo: printf() function - This program shows that
 the printf() function does not automatically break its own line. */

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("This is the first line.");
    printf("This is the second line.");
    printf("This is the third line.");
    printf("This is the forth line.");
    return 0;
}
